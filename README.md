# TODO APP
 Creating a ToDo list app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a practical and hands-on project that incorporates essential web development skills. In this project, I've implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, which are fundamental for managing tasks within the application.
 By implementing CRUD operations, I've not only built a practical ToDo list application but also gained valuable experience in managing data within a web environment. This project demonstrates my proficiency in front-end technologies(HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT) and lays the foundation for further exploration into full-stack development.
